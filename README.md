**Required Parts to build the robot are as follows:**
•	Chassis (including motors and wheels )
•	Arduino Uno r3
•	L293D Motor Shield
•	IR Proximity Sensors (pair)
•	Jumper Wires
•	Switch
•	4AA Battery Holder

**Working Steps**
First, I collect all the components I need. Then, I learned how to build the car and finished it first. Then, I started searching for how to connect the components and connected them after. And then started coding; During this stage, I encountered several problems such as:
**1- In the first one, I was running the robot with one IR sensor:**
 This enables the robot to move forward and stop only, and it is Inaccurate in determining the line it will walk on.
To solve this, I made it works with two sensors :
  Which enables the robot to move forward, right, left, and stop
 ( which is our target).
**2- In the second one:**
The wheels spin properly as we want them to, But when they are placed on the track, They can't move. 
To solve this:
After researching, I came up with several possibilities, And I had worked on fixing this issue, Which made the robot work as intended.
